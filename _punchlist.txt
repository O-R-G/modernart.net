+ Humphries images are quite slow to load and all of them are scaling 
strangely all browsers
+ humphries file sizes are almost twice as large as other artists
+ In general in all browsers: When opening an image on an artist’s page 
for the first time, it often takes a very long time to load, and when you 
click ‘next’, it jumps to a close up or detail of a part of the previous 
image. In safari: often the images get ‘stuck’ on a single shot, and you 
can’t scroll forward, usually only during the first time the images of a 
particular artist are opened
+ first image popped up does not match the caption
+ open-records-generator submodule sort out -- see ON-RUN-GO/git/submodule.txt
+ utf-8 encoding in open-records-generator

  works for artists, make it work for exhibitions
+ google analytics
+ ** debug ** safari exit fullscreen shifts position of captions
- url encoding still little fussy with ":" in front or when editing
